<!-- The data.js file loads in data but also does much more.
  It creates an object called "sources" (see the file for the code)
  which specifies all of the little regions with appear on the webpage;
  ie. it specifies the webpage should have a Reference genome,
  a Scale, specify the Location the user is looking at, show
  the Variant bar, etc.
  This object is then loaded in by the playground.js file below,
  which renders the specified things onto the webpage.

<!--
The playground.js file actually loads the visualization into the web browser.
To do this it uses a function which is defined and then added to the global
window object by ../dist/pileup.js so playground.js can later access it.
For more information, see playground.js.
